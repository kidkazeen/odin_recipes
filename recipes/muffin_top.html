        <p>
            A muffin is an individually portioned baked 
            product, however the term can refer to one 
            of two distinct items: a part-raised flatbread 
            (like a crumpet) that is baked and then cooked 
            on a griddle (typically unsweetened), or a 
            (often sweetened) quickbread that is chemically leavened 
            and then baked in a mold. While quickbread "American" 
            muffins are often sweetened, there are savory 
            varieties made with ingredients such as corn and 
            cheese, and less sweet varieties like traditional 
            bran muffins. The flatbread "English" variety is of 
            British or other European derivation, and dates from 
            at least the early 18th century, while the quickbread 
            originated in North America during the 19th century. 
            Both types are common worldwide today.
