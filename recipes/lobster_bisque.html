        <h3>Medium Lobster Bisque</h3>
        
        <p>
            Bisque is a smooth, creamy, highly 
            seasoned soup of French origin, 
            classically based on a strained broth 
            (coulis) of crustaceans.[1] It can be 
            made from lobster, langoustine, crab, 
            shrimp or crayfish. The French bisque 
            is one of the most popular seafood 
            soups around the world.
