    <p>
        Wheat-rye bread, including light rye (sissel), 
        American pumpernickel, and the combination of 
        the two as marbled rye, is closely associated 
        with Jewish cuisine and Jewish-American cuisine, 
        particularly the delicatessen. The bulk of the 
        flour is white wheat flour (often a less-refined 
        form known as first clear), with a substantial 
        portion of rye mixed in for color and flavor. 
        The dough is often leavened, in whole or in part, 
        with sourdough, but sometimes uses a small addition 
        of citric acid or vinegar to achieve the lowered 
        pH needed to neutralize the rye amylases. The 
        so-called Jewish rye is further seasoned with 
        whole caraway fruits and glazed with an egg 
        wash, and is traditionally associated with salted 
        meats such as corned beef and pastrami.
