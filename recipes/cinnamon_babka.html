        A babka is a sweet braided bread which originated in 
        the Jewish communities of Poland and Ukraine. 
        It is popular in Israel (often referred to as simply 
        a yeast cake: עוגת שמרים) and in the Jewish diaspora. It 
        is prepared with a yeast-leavened dough that is rolled 
        out and spread with a filling such as chocolate, 
        cinnamon, fruit, or cheese, then rolled up and braided 
        before baking.
