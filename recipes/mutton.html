        Lamb, hogget, and mutton, generically sheep 
        meat, are the meat of domestic sheep, Ovis 
        aries. A sheep in its first year is a lamb 
        and its meat is also lamb. The meat from sheep 
        in their second year is hogget. Older sheep 
        meat is mutton. Generally, "hogget" and 
        "sheep meat" are not used by consumers outside 
        Norway, New Zealand, South Africa, Scotland, 
        and Australia. Hogget has become more common 
        in England, particularly in the North 
        (Lancashire and Yorkshire) often in association 
        with rare breed and organic farming.
