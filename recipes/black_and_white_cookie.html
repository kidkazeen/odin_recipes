        <h3>Black and White Cookie</h3>

        <p>
            Black-and-white cookies, half-and-half cookies, and 
            half-moon cookies are similar round cookies iced or  
            frosted in two colors, with one half vanilla and the other 
            chocolate. They are found in the Northeastern United States 
            and Florida. Black-and-white cookies are flat, have fondant 
            or sometimes royal icing on a dense cake base, and are common 
            in the New York metropolitan area. Half-moon cookies are 
            slightly dome-shaped (convex), have frosting on a fluffy 
            angel cake base, and are common in Central New York 
            and Boston, Massachusetts.

            <li>Boiling water, as needed</li>
            <li>1½ tablespoons light corn syrup</li>

            <li>2½ tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oven to 375 degrees. Arrange racks in top and 
                bottom thirds, and line two rimmed baking sheets 
                with parchment paper.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking 
                powder, sea salt and baking soda. In a medium 
                bowl, whisk together sour cream, milk, vanilla, 
                lemon zest and almond extract.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with 
                the paddle attachment, beat together butter 
                and granulated sugar until light and fluffy, 
                about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time, 
                until combined, scraping the sides of the bowl 
                as necessary.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Reduce speed to low and beat in ⅓ of the 
                flour mixture, then ⅓ of the sour cream mixture. 
                Repeat until both mixtures are incorporated, scraping 
                sides of bowl as necessary. (Mixture will be the 
                consistency of thick poundcake batter.)
            </li>

            <li>
                Dollop heaping ¼-cup scoops of batter onto 
                prepared baking sheets, spacing them 2 inches 
                apart. (You should have 12 to 14 cookies.) Bake 
                for 6 minutes. Rotate the baking sheets. Continue 
                to bake until the cookies have firmed up and spring 
                back when lightly pressed in the center, 6 to 9 
                minutes. (They’ll brown only on the bottoms.) Take 
                care not to overbake, or they will dry out.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Transfer baking sheets to wire racks and let 
                cool for 15 minutes, then transfer cookies 
                directly to racks to cool completely.
            </li>

            <li>
                While the cookies cool, make the glaze: 
                Place the confectioners’ sugar in a 
                medium bowl and whisk in 3 tablespoons 
                boiling water, the corn syrup, vanilla and 
                salt. Continue to whisk, adding more boiling 
                water as needed, until you have a thick yet 
                spreadable frosting that is the texture of hot 
                fudge sauce. (Too thick is preferable to too thin.) 
                Flip each cookie over and spoon glaze over half of 
                its flat side, spreading to edges with the back of 
                the spoon. Place on wire rack to set. You will have 
                vanilla frosting left over.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Whisk melted chocolate into vanilla frosting, 
                then whisk in cocoa and enough room temperature 
                water to make a thick yet spreadable glaze. Glaze 
                the bare half of each cookie. Let glaze set for at 
                least 1 to 2 hours before serving.
