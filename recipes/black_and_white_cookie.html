        <h3>Black and White Cookie</h3>

        <p>
            Black-and-white cookies, half-and-half cookies, and 
            half-moon cookies are similar round cookies iced or  
            frosted in two colors, with one half vanilla and the other 
            chocolate. They are found in the Northeastern United States 
            and Florida. Black-and-white cookies are flat, have fondant 
            or sometimes royal icing on a dense cake base, and are common 
            in the New York metropolitan area. Half-moon cookies are 
            slightly dome-shaped (convex), have frosting on a fluffy 
            angel cake base, and are common in Central New York 
            and Boston, Massachusetts.
